Winter 2022 Midterm Test     

APS 360 Last Name: First Name: Student Number: Applied Fundamentals of Machine Learning Date : March 04, 2022 Duration: 120 minutes (90 min + 30 min for Crowdmark submission) Aids Allowed: All Quercus Notes Instructors: Kaveh Hassani, Jaspreet Sahota Do not turn this page until you have received the signal to start. In the meantime, please read the instructions below carefully. This test consists of 9 questions on 26 pages (including this one), printed on both sides of the paper. 

 

When you receive the signal to start, please make sure that your copy of the test is complete, fill in the identification section above, including your student number. Answer each question directly on the test paper, in the space provided, using either a blue or black pen or a pencil. If you need more space for one of your solutions,

 

 use the extra pages at the end of the test paper and indicate clearly the part of your work that should be marked. Write up your solutions carefully! Marks cannot be awarded for solu- tions that are not understandable by the grader, and may be deducted if you make false assertions. If you are giving only one part of an answer, 

 

indi- cate clearly what you are doing. Part marks might be given for incomplete solutions.

 (A) optimizer.zero_grad() 

(B) optimizer.step() 

(C) loss.backward() * (1 marks)

 (D) loss = criterion(model(inputs), labels) Part 

(h) [1 mark] Which of the following is correct?

 (A) Smaller batch sizes typically allow using larger learning rates. 

(B) We optimize the weights on training set and the hyper- parameters on the test set. 

(C) We can increase the learning rate as training progresses. 

(D) For the problems discussed in class, neural networks are typically unable to find the global optimal.

 

 1 ( (E) marks)Using a standard adaptive learning rate method reduce the memory usage. Part (i) [1 mark] Suppose we have an input image of size 3×15×15 and we apply a kernel of size 3×4×4 with padding of size 2 and stride of 1, followed by a pooling with kernel size of 4×4 and strides of 4. What are the di- mensions of the output? 

 

(A) 3×4×4 (B) 1×4×4 * (1 marks) (C) 3×8×8 (D) 1×8×8 Part (j) [1 mark] Which of the following is incorrect about convolutional neural networks?

 

 (A) They are more efficient compared to fully-connected net- works.

 (B) As we go deeper, height and width are decreased while depth is increased. 

(C) We can use either convolution with strides or pooling layers to reduce the depth. * (1 marks) 

(D) Kernels of size 3×3 can approximate bigger kernel sizes. Page 3 of 26 over. . .
